A bootstrap for a lib in PHP. Don't set, just code!  

This bootstrap will install all the basic files and settings to start a PHP library. 


## Installation


First, use composer to create your project. (Note that composer will also create all the repositories if they do not exist.)

```
$ composer create-project raphhh/puppy-service path/to/my/project
```

Go into your project.

```
$ cd path/to/my/project
```

Finally, run PHPUnit to test the installation.

```
$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

## Customisation

If tests are ok, that means you can start your project.
You just need to replace composer.json and README.md with your specific info.

After this customisation, just code.
